    "Washington, D.C. is the capital of the United States. Washington's population is approaching 700,000 people, and has been growing since 2000 following a half-century of population decline. The city is highly segregated and features a high cost of living. In 2017, the average price of a single family home in the district was $649,000. \n",

    "Understanding the various features and similarities between the various neighborhoods provides important insights into the housing market within the district. This analysis will serve as means for a real estate agency to develop profiles of the various wards in DC. By better understanding the housing characteristics of the different wards they can better recommend specific areas to begin there search based on the clients needs.\n",

    "We will measure effectivenss of different clustering algorithms to seperate various types of homes from the DC data set. For example single family homes on large plots of land should be considered as a different type of home than downtown flat in a 10 story building. The process of evaluating will be based on two criteria.\n",
